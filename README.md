# Learning React Native

The code in this project was written in conjunction with a [Linkedin Learning course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-react-native/framework-of-learning-react?u=67553266). This code is not my own, but written from a tutorial. 

Screenshots of the implemented functionality of this tutorial's app can be shown
below. Using the Expo framework, I was able to test the app on my iPhone.
